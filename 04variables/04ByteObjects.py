In Python, a bytes object is a sequence of bytes. It is an immutable sequence, similar to a string, but instead of representing characters, it represents a sequence of bytes where each byte can have a value from 0 to 255. The bytes type is often used to handle binary data, such as images, sound files, or network protocols.

Here are some ways to create bytes objects:
"""
# byte_data=b"hello"
byte_data=bytes([104, 101, 108, 111])
byte_data=bytes("hello", "utf-8")
print(byte_data)
